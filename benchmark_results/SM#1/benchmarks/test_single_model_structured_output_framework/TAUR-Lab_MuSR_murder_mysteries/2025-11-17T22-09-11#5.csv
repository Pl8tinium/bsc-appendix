The physical,evidence aligns most strongly with Russell: his access to bleach, the fact he gave Zoe a drink, and his motive due to being exposed all makehim the most probable killer. The circumstantial evidence—giving Zoe adrink during the flight, right after she had threatened his illegal smuggling and clear knowledge of her police reports—makes it hard to seehow Alice could have administered the poison without clear opportunityRussell's provision of the drink at the pivotal moment is a direct anddecisive connection that Alice lacks. Although Alice is linked to boththe substance and the behavioral symptoms of guilt, the actual act of,administering bleach was most plausibly performed by Russell, who had,given Zoe a drink directly. This physical point—in conjunction with a,psychological motive—solidifies Russell as the likely perpetrator. Hisactions—nervous behavior when confronted, clear motive due to being atrisk from exposure, and the unambiguous act of giving Zoe a drink, tipthe balance. While Alice's nervousness and history with bleach raise afew suspicions, it remains circumstantial rather than substantive. In summary, the strongest evidence connects Russell to Zoe’s murder: he (Russell both had access to the murder weapon (bleach) and a clear, un-deniable opportunity (passing Zoe a drink on the flight). The scenariopoints decisively toward Russell. He possessed both a powerful motive—

reasoning=To answer the question of who the most likely murderer is, let's breakLet us weigh the critical evidence. Both suspects—Peyton and Isolde—k0Both women are skilled with a sai and had motive. Peyton was present, Isolde had a strong motive: evidence of her prejudice, prior argumentsbetween suspect and victim, and a missing sai from her bar's display,.Isolde's opportunity is strong: she worked at the bar in the mall at 9pm, exactly when the murder took place, giving her immediate access tothe scene. The mall is also Isolde’s professional territory, and oneofher sai weapons was missing right after the crime, matching the murderweapon. Peyton has plausible opportunity—she was at the mall that day,but her motive appears weaker—there is no evidence of direct animosityWhile both suspects had access and skill, Isolde stands out due to herblatant motive, and the physical evidence (missing sai from her bar's,display and her antagonism toward Guy. Peyton is suspicious, but lacksdirect motive. The prejudice, prior conflict, and missing weapon tie aclear line to Isolde. The alignment of her motive, opportunity, and a weapon trace point most convincingly to Isolde. While Peyton’s skills,presence, and opportunity are suspicious, the motive and the direct, cconnection to the crime scene—especially the missing sai from her bar,tip the scales. Isolde's proactive animosity toward Guy, validated by her demonstrated bias, habitual presence at the scene, and ownership (of the missing weapon, consolidates the case against her. Moreover, Isolde's inconsistent behavior, such as her avoidance of direct eye 



contact during questioning, corroborated by CCTV evidence of her closeinteraction with Guy on the evening in question, further cements the 'connection. Furthermore, witnesses confirm Isolde and Guy argued, and,the forensic detail that the murder weapon matches the missing sai in/Isolde's bar cannot be dismissed: the weapon's origin directly ties toIsolde. Peyton, although present and skilled with a sai, lacks a clearmotive or personal grievance, whereas Isolde's hostility was well-dragdocumented and her missing sai provides a direct physical link. In sumthe preponderance of the evidence—motive, opportunity, and the direct,connection to the murder weapon—makes Isolde the strongest suspect. Inconclusion, Isolde's combination of motive, opportunity, and the clearphysical evidence of her missing sai from the bar and the public, wellwitnessed antagonism toward the victim is overwhelming. The unique, esIn examining all the facts, Isolde's strong and documented animosity,,

Her statement about deserving 'svere punishment,' paired with her direct involvement in preparing Ivyʼdrinks, suggests opportunity and intent.

Thereis also strong circumstantial evidence: Bria was planning to testify, against Serenity for her illegal insect collection—which could be a CRSerenity also showed a habit of carrying her hatchet everywhere, whichis consistent with both her background and the weapon found. The clin ching point is the forensic match between Serenity's hatchet and the murder weapon, combined with her strong motive—fear of being exposed, from Bria's potential testimony. Naomi's injuries and teaching role donot provide the same direct tie to the weapon or crime scene. While itis possible Naomi harbored anger or even opportunity, there is no hardevidence directly implicating her in the act itself. Given the hatchetfound in Serenity's possession matches the murder weapon exactly, and,Serenity's connection to the crime is much stronger. Not only does shehave motive (to prevent damaging testimony) and means (her own hatchet), but the forensic evidence establishes unique opportunity. The fact,that Serenity brought her murder weapon to the library and was seen bymultiple witnesses handling that hatchet undermines any suggestion of,an accidental or unrelated use of the tool. Furthermore, Serenity's unusual behavior of carrying and sharpening the hatchet further ties herto the crime. Her motive—avoiding legal repercussions from Bria's dam-aging testimony—aligned with both opportunity and direct physical linkGiven all the details, Serenity stands out as the primary suspect: she

This level of control, combined with clear evidence of strained personal history and a confession of discovering unauthorized materials in Julian's belongings, points squarely to direct opportunity and motive.
