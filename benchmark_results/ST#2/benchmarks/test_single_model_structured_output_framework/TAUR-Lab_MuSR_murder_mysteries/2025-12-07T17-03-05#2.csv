The eyewitness account placing Glenn at the zoo around the time of Walter's death aligns suspiciously with his routine. The tool bag he carried could easily conceal a nail gun, and his knowledge of the fact that Walter knew about his past and threatened to expose it.provides a strong motive for Glenn to silence Walter before he couldreveal his criminal history.

Ert background also suggests familiarity with handling such devices, andhis sudden defensiveness when confronted about the synagogue funds was a strong indicator of guilt. Moreover, Ervin's routine and the timing of the crime also aligns with the deserted hockey rink, a location Erwas frequent, giving him ample chance to plant the device without aroint suspicion. His hardened demeanor, shaped by years of military discipline, coupled with his volatile temper—evidenced by the synagogue outled him to act preemptively.

However, his deep-seated resentment of Philip’s abuse toward his family may have pushed him to a breaking point. On the other hand, Jim’s evasiveness, his confirmed presence in the desert at the time of the murder, coupled with his financial and the threat of exposure due to the ledger make him a stronger conting motive. The ledger’s discovery with Philip’s body directly implichim as the more plausible suspect. His reaction to the ledger’s revealalso suggests a desperate attempt to silence Philip permanently. Whilehis motive is far more immediate and pressing—Philip’s knowledge ofJims illegal activities could have led to a violent confrontation. The nuncha was the weapon used, and Jim’s familiarity with the desert—where the crime occurred—further strengthens the case against him. His evasion suggests he had more to lose. Additionally, Jim’s frequent desert solitude aligns with the crime scene’s isolation, making it easier for him to act. Witnesses placing Jim in the desert, his refusal to conceal his actions. The nunchaku, though associated with Woodrow’s hJim is the most likely murderer. RESULT: [Jim]

His alibiwas weakened by his presence at the track during the time Gary's keys——went missing, and his unrestricted access to Gary's office. The escaling tensions between them due to Gary's accusations of cheating only added to the motive. However, Frederick’s late presence at the track, particularly during the murder window, raises questions. Witnesses,包括the security guard, placed him at the track during the murder. His go-kart was also suspicious, as Gary had been seen tampering with it. TheRESULT: Jerome is the most likely murderer.
