The continuation should extend the last reply without breaking sentence structure. Since the last response was cut off, I need to continue from where it left off, making sure the sentences flow when concatenated. The previous response pointed to Emma as the murderer based on several clues. I need to extend that by adding another point or elaborating further without starting a new idea. Also, the continuation should be a fragment if the last sentence was incomplete, so I'll avoid ending with punctuation unless it naturally completes a thought. Looking at the last part: 'This, coupled with her orchestration,' – it seems like an incomplete thought. So I should continue from 'orchestration' by adding more details, perhaps about the zoo trip or her access. I'll make sure the continuation is a seamless extension. For meta_talk, I can mention my thought process to show I'm following instructions. Let's structure the continuation to link 'orchestration' to the fatal event, keeping it within a reasonable length.
