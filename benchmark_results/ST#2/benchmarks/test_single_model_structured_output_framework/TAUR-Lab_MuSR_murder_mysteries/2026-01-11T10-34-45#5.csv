Let me summarize the reasoning succinctly while adhering to the character limit constraints. First, Zelda had a strong motive: as the museum curator, she was dedicated to protecting its reputation, and Gustavo's testimony about mismanagement could have caused a scandal. She had access to the murder weapon—the antique sickle she showed Winston—and the authority to handle museum weapons. She admitted meeting Gustavo at the swamp on the day of the murder and was seen there by a local resident. Her explanation about research seems plausible but also provides opportunity. In contrast, Autumn and her gang had a grudge against Gustavo due to a public humiliation, and she knew the swamp well, but the weapon link is weaker (no direct connection to the sickle). The narrative emphasizes Zelda's knowledge and handling of the sickle, while Autumn's involvement is more circumstantial (mail, gang feud). The puzzle pieces—antique weapons, museum scandal, curator's presence—point to Zelda. Therefore, I'll state that Zelda is the most likely murderer. I must wrap up in 1-2 sentences and end with ANSWER[Zelda]. The response should be complete within the character limit. I'll avoid unfinished thoughts. Final reasoning: Zelda had motive, means (access to the sickle), and opportunity (at the swamp with Gustavo), making her the prime suspect."", ""schema_retries"": ""0""
