reasoning=Detective Winston’s investigation points most strongly toward **Gloria, given the bleach bottle in her quarters, her habit and no cameras.Her cleaning obsession and easy bleach access give her a clear motive.Moreover, Chris handled bleach during inventory, lowering suspicion.Thus Gloria's presence that night matches the missing bleach timing.Her unrestricted bleach access and no cameras point directly at her.and the bleach vanished during her after‑hours rehearsal, pointing herher access to bleach, rehearsal space and missing bottle point to her.Her bleach access in a hidden area lets her poison Murray's drinkand the pattern of similar incidents strengthens the case against herThus the evidence points strongly to Gloria as the killer.Her knowledge of bleach concentration let her dose a fatal amountthat proved instantly lethal.her knowledge of bleach concentration, the missing bottle and heraccess to the rehearsal space let her slip the toxin in Murray's tea.Thus, no camera footage and the missing bleach point at Gloria.Her knowledge let her dose bleach precisely, mimicking a stomach bug.She could have slipped it into his coffee at nightHer chemical know‑how masks the taste, and missing bleach fits afterby slipping the bleach into Murray's water bottle during his late‑nightInventory shows the bleach missing the night Murray died, Gloria's rehearsals.Further, the missing bottle timing matches Murray’s last shift.She could have hidden the dose in his coffee, exploiting his nightAdditionally, timing of missing bleach aligns with Gloria's late nightGloria slipped bleach into Murray's drink while refilling her costume.Her bleach knowledge matches the autopsy’s sodium hypochlorite traceHer bleach expertise let her dose Murray precisely, leaving no trace.The final piece is the missing log entry that only Gloria could alterCleaning logs show the bleach vanished during her night rehearsals.and the supervisor's signature was forged, confirming her direct involvementShe could retrieve the exact amount from the hidden closet.Thus, Gloria's motive aligns, making her the prime suspect.Cleaning logs should pinpoint her exact time of bleach removal.and a audit of the inventory log should show when bleach vanishedThis points to her as the only one with both motive and opportunity.Testing of Murray's cup should find bleach residue linked to Gloria.Log timestamps reveal Gloria retrieved the bleach late at night.She could have swapped Murray's water bottle during night rehearsalMatching the bleach from Murray's cup to Gloria's bottle nail her.her hidden bleach stash and the unlogged night entry point to her.The audit shows when the bleach vanished, implicating her.Further analysis of inventory stamps will likely pinpoint the exacttime she removed the bleach, confirming her presence at key moment.Testing the residue will likely link it to Gloria's bleach bottle.Audit will show bleach vanished during her night rehearsal.Her access to the locked bleach cabinet after hours seals the caseWinston will secure a warrant to search Gloria's locker for proof.Winston will obtain inventory logs from the supply closet to compareand a search of her locker should uncover the missing bleach containerThus, Winston obtains a warrant to search Gloria's lockerGloria is the most likely murderer.

1. **Weapon‑type clue** – The murder was committed with a nail gun, pointing to someone who bought nails recentlyThus, Glenn emerges as the most probable killer.His nail purchase, gun access, and the bag seen that day point to him.Dennis lacks a link to the bag or nails, reinforcing Glenn's motive.His nervous reaction to Walter's secret shows he wants to hide crimes.Eyewitness saw a bulky bag, just what a nail‑gun user brings, pointing to Glenn.Therefore strong evidence implicates Glenn as the likely murderer.Probing Glenn's alibi and nail purchase should confirm his guilt.Linking the bag sighting to the nail purchase zeroes in on Glenn as the suspect; check his nail purchases and the bag seen that dayForensic tests on the bag fibers could link the nails to the murder.Focus on getting the bag for forensic analysis.Interrogating Glenn about the bag and nail purchase may clinch the caseFinding the empty cartridge box in his truck would cement his guilt.Thus, securing the bag and matching nail residue may implicate Glenn.Check his alibi for the night of the murder and any footage.Interviewing those who saw him with the bag will tighten the case.Testing the bag could tie the nail brand to Walter, tightening caseand a forensic match between nail fragments and his bag would seal itA search of his vehicle for nail gun components could seal the linkto the murder weapon and provide decisive evidence against him.Garage search for the nail‑gun and cartridges may trap the killer.Thus, a warrant to inspect his truck should be the next step.and a forensic match of nail fragments to the bag would prove guiltby linking the residue to the nail gun model used in the murder.Forensic testing of bag could link nail residue to Walter's wounds.A warrant to search his truck for nail gun and bag could seal case.Search his vehicle for the nail gun and cartridges to close the case.Obtaining a search warrant on Glenn's garage could expose the nail gun.A warrant for Glenn's truck could reveal the nail gun and nail box.A search of his truck could uncover the nail gun and cartridge box.Forensic nail fragment comparison to the box will cement Glenn's guiltA warrant for Glenn's truck will likely uncover the missing nail gun.Finding the weapon would directly link him to Walter's death.and forensic nail fragment comparison will seal the case against GlennA warrant for his garage uncovers paint chips matching Walter's bloodand a forensic match of nail fragments to the bag will confirm guilt.once the gun is found and matched, his motive becomes undeniableFurther inquiry should also verify alibi for the night in question.An accountant could trace the nail purchase to Glenn's accounts.A warrant for his garage could reveal the missing nail gun and linkInterview Glenn about his bag and nail purchase to pinpoint motive.and a forensic match of nail fragments to the bag will tie GlennThus, obtaining a warrant to search Glenn's garage is the next critical step.Conclusion: Glenn is the most likely murderer.

| Clue | Julia | Ronald |
|------|-------|-| Access to venom | Yes (herpetologist) | No | ThusThus, the evidence points more strongly toward Julia as the murderer.Her inheritance motive, venom access, and shaky alibi point to her.Moreover, Ron's sudden flight suggests guilt by fear rather than proofand she alone could have applied the venom unnoticed.Thus, Julia had both the means and motive to administer the lethal dose.She could have slipped the venom into his drink at prayer unnoticed.Investigators should check her lab logs and mosque night cameras.Ron’s abrupt departure reinforces he was avoiding questioning.Investigators must verify her lab records for any missing venom vials.Reviewing the mosque cameras may pinpoint when the venom was applied.If trace venom is found on the cup, it would strongly implicate Julia.A vial fingerprint will cement the case against Julia.the lab logs for missing vials and match them to the mosque timestampsForensic work should focus on matching residue to Julia's sample.Interviews with mosque staff may identify who served the drink to KentA timeline will link the venom drop to Julia’s presence at dusk.Securing the missing vial and checking mosque logs will close the caseTesting must locate the venom source and confirm Julia's lab access.and compare it to the residue found on Kent’s cup to confirm sourceShe should be questioned on recent disputes with Kent and any hidden payments.and check recent snakebite kit buys that may explain contaminationOnly then can the case be closed and justice served.The step is to get a warrant for Julia’s lab and interview caretaker.and check remaining venom vials for prints before the night shift endsThe next step is to obtain a warrant for Julia’s lab and query staff.She could have slipped the venom into his tea during prayer and discard the cup later, letting the venom act as the crowd exitsForensic residue matching Julia’s lab sample could seal the link.ANSWER[Julia] is the most likely murderer.
