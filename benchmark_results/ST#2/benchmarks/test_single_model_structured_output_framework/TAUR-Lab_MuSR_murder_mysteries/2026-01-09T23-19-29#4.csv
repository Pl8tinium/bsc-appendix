However, the timeline of the shower relative to the murder isn't explicitly verified, just stated.\n\n**Evidence against Freya:**\n*   **Motive:** Eleanor had loaned her money, but Freya was in bankruptcy and struggling. Eleanor was threatening to expose Freya's illegal artifact transactions if the debt wasn't repaid. This gives a strong motive to silence Eleanor permanently.\n*   **Means:** Winston explicitly notices a halberd in Freya's collection that \""matched the one found at the crime scene.\"" She is also skilled in combat with medieval weapons, unlike Elizabeth who just supervises props.\n*   **Opportunity:** Freya was present at Eleanor's wrestling match (the crime scene location) during the weekend market, as witnessed by multiple people. She had a public argument with Eleanor shortly before the death.\n\n**Comparison:**\nWhile Elizabeth has personal motives and access to a prop, the prop is likely a standard stage item. Freya actually owns a matching halberd and maintains it. Crucially, Freya was seen at the scene of the crime (the public square/wrestling match) and had a heated argument there immediately prior to the murder. The financial blackmail aspect provides a more urgent, desperate motive for murder than the affair. The specific matching of the weapon and the presence at the scene make Freya the stronger suspect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFreya is the most likely murderer because she was present at the crime scene with a matching weapon and combat skills, driven by a desperate need to silence Eleanor's threats regarding her financial crimes and illegal dealings."", ""schema_retries"": ""0""
