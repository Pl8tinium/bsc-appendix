First, Murray was killed by ingesting bleach. The two suspects are Gloria and Chris. Gloria hasa bleach bottle in her rehearsal space, reads obituaries, and studieschemicals, and works late in the same building. Chris also has bleach,and he had a motive because Murray made a game decision that cost histeam a championship. He also had a prior incident where an athleteaccidentally ingested cleaning fluid. Gloria’s bleach was for costume hygiene, but she lacked an obvious motive, whereas Chris had both themotive and the past poisoning incident, making him more suspicious. Inaddition, Winston noted Chris’s evasiveness about the game loss andthe empty bleach bottle in his office. Furthermore, Gloria’s late–night presence could be a coincidence, while Chris's history and clearconnection to bleach and a possible grudge against Murray suggests apattern of poisoning behavior.Moreover, Winston likely considered that Chris had both means and a grand opportunity given his duties and presence near Murray’s office.Chris's history with cleaning agents and his proximity to Murray'soffice makes him the most plausible culprit.

We have two suspects:

She knew Tracy died, but no clear link to the cinema murder scene or a direct urgent reasonkill Tracy at that event. Gloria, however, worked at Slice & Dice, wasa fan of The Butchers, had access to promotional meat cleavers linkedto the band, and was in love with the lead singer. Tracy planned to gopublic with her affair, which threatened Gloria's fantasy and idolizedrelationship with him. This gave Gloria a strong emotional motive toeliminate Tracy at the premiere. The murder weapon was a meat cleaver,which is fitting for Gloria's workplace and the band's theme, and themurder happened at a rock band event where Gloria was present, makingopportunity and means readily available.Moreover, Gloria’s presence at the cinema during the premiere, her fanstatus and access to meat cleavers fit the crime scene. Gloria alsowould have had both means and emotional drive to act in the moment.
