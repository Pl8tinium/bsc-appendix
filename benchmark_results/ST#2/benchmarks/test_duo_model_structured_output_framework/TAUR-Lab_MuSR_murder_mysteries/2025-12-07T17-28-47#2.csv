Alice's possession of bleach bottles and her admission to researching its usein a spiritual cleansing ritual gives her both means and potential preed motive: Zoe was about to expose Alice’s fraud, which could ruin hercareer. Additionally, Alice was present when Zoe discovered the papers and had the opportunity to tamper with Zoe’s drink. The bleach-likebbottles she carried could easily be confused for drink containers, andher admission to accidentally ingesting bleach earlier also hints at ameans to poison her. While both suspects had access to bleach, only Alice had the strongest motive—preventing exposure—coupled with theopportunity to poison Zoe during the flight. The method of murder—bleach in Zoe’s drink aligns perfectly with Alice’s knowledge of bleach’sand her proximity to Zoe’s beverage during the flight, making her theRESULT: Alice is the most likely murderer.

However,她motive is strong, but her emotional connection to Jamal as a grandson, seems to complicate her role as a suspect. On the other hand, Lillianhad a clear motive as the goddaughter poised to inherit Jamal's power, and her expertise in amphibian toxins makes her a formidable suspect. She also had the scientific knowledge to use the poison effectively.  The contradictions in her alibi—claiming a strict curfew while beingsneaking out late at night—suggest she may have had the opportunity to commit the crime. Additionally, her ambition to fill Jamal's shoes, aand her access to the same type of lethal frog poison, aligns directly with the means and opportunity to execute such a precise murder. Her晚late-night activities could have provided her with the chance to plant the murder. The RESULT to the QUESTION is: Lillian.

We know Kent was killed by snake venom, and Julia’s profession as a herpetologist provided her withaccess to venom and knowledge of handling snakes. She also had a clear motive—her inheritance was bypassed in favor of Kent, and he was a threat in her lawsuit. Ronald, on the other hand, works at a zoo with venomous snakes, giving him access to the murder weapon as well. Hismotive is less clear but possibly related to Kent having documents on past misdemeanors, suggesting a hidden conflict. However, Julia’s al­is placed directly at the scene with Kent at the mosque on the day of the murder, and her admission of an altercation with Kent earlierthatday strengthens suspicion. Ronald’s flight upon mention of the incriminating behavior—such as fleeing when confronted—does raise questions,but it could be interpreted as a sign of guilt related to the blackmailments rather than direct evidence of murder. Additionally, Julia’s专professional expertise in herpetology means she would know exactly how to administer the venom effectively.

His violent outburst at the synagogue also suggests a volatile temper that could escalate to murder.

His military training as a BombDisposal Technician gave him expertise to use explosives. Otis had a routine, which Andrew knew intimately. This allowed Andrew to plantthe grenade at the rink when Otis would be alone. The forensic link to the recent military base theft directly tied Andrew to the murder.
