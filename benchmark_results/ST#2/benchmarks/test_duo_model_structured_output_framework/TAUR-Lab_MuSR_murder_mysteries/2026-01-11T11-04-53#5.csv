Zelda explicitly has an antique sickle in her collection which she handles. This links the method of killing directly to her.\n    *   **Motive:** Zelda's motive is immediate and high-stakes (career/reputation ruin via testimony).

Marjorie (Live-in nanny):\n        - Owns a Huntsman knife (used for cutting fruit).\n        - Knife is missing from the Johnson household.\n        - Traced to a local store selling the same type of hunting knife on the day of the murder.\n        - Eyewitness placed Marjorie in Times Square at the time of the murder.\n        - Witness saw the Johnson boys in Times Square without her (Wait, text says \""boys had been seen... without their usual, vigilant nanny\"" while \""eyewitness placed Marjorie in the vicinity\"". This implies she was there but not with the kids, or the witness placing her there contradicts the witness who saw the boys without her? Or perhaps she was there doing the deed while the boys wandered).\n        - Recorded leaving the Johnson estate around the time of the murder.\n        - Obsessively clean (maybe to clean up evidence?).\n        - Employer saw her sharpen the knife that morning.\n    2. Cecilia (Knife vendor):\n        - Sells hunting knives (the same kind).\n        - Ana was investigating her legality (\""snapping pictures\"", \""asking about legal implications\"", \""anonymous tip\"").\n        - Cecilia found the tip on Ana's phone (Wait, \""Found an anonymous tip against me on her phone\"" - did she have the phone? Or does she mean she knows there was a tip? The text says \""Found an anonymous tip... on her phone\"" - this implies Cecilia might have possessed Ana's phone or saw it, which is suspicious).\n        - Uses a hunting knife daily.\n        - Has a motive (Ana threatening her business).\n\nComparing the two:\n- Marjorie:\n    - Weapon matches her type (Huntsman).\n    - Her specific knife is missing.\n    - She was at the scene (vicinity).\n    - She bought a similar knife that day (replacement? or spare?).\n    - Sharpened it that morning.\n- Cecilia:\n    - Access to weapons.\n    - Motive (business threat).\n    - Suspicious comment about the phone (\""Found an anonymous tip... on her phone\""). How did she see Ana's phone unless she was close to her or stole it after the murder?\n    - However, the narrative focuses heavily on Marjorie's suspicious behavior: the missing knife, the purchase, the sharpening, the cleaning obsession (hiding secrets), and being recorded leaving the estate at the time of the murder.\n    - The narrative spends the second half detailing Marjorie's timeline and the missing knife, framing her as the primary person of interest (\""placed Marjorie high on his list\"").\n\nThe prompt asks for \""Who is the most likely murderer?\"".\nThe text explicitly says Marjorie is high on the list.\nThe evidence of the missing specific knife, the purchase of a new one, sharpening it, and being at the scene points strongly to Marjorie. The \""cleanliness\"" aspect suggests a desire to remove evidence.\nCecilia's involvement seems to be a red herring or just background tension, though the phone comment is odd. But Marjorie has physical evidence (missing weapon) and opportunity (leaving estate at time of murder, seen in vicinity).\n\nConclusion: Marjorie.\n\nConstraint Checklist & Confidence Score:\n1.

Do NOT leave sentences unfinished? Yes.\n7. Adhere to character limit (prioritize finishing thought)? Yes.\n\nConfidence Score: 5/5.\n\nMental Sandbox Simulation:\nDrafting the reasoning:\nMarjorie possessed a hunting knife identical to the murder weapon, which is now missing, and was seen in Times Square at the time of the crime after sharpening it that morning. While Cecilia had a motive, the physical evidence and Marjorie's suspicious timeline make her the prime suspect.\n\nDrafting the final tag: ANSWER[Marjorie]\n\nCheck constraints:\n- Reasoning in 1-2 sentences. (Yes, the draft is 2 sentences).\n- End with ANSWER[...]. (Yes).\n\nLet's refine the reasoning to be concise and punchy based on the provided text.\n\""Marjorie is the most likely murderer because her hunting knife is missing, she was seen in Times Square at the time of the crime, and she sharpened the weapon earlier that day.\"" -> This is one sentence.\nLet's try to make it slightly more comprehensive but short. \""Marjorie is the primary suspect due to her missing hunting knife matching the murder weapon, her presence in Times Square during the crime, and the fact she sharpened the blade that morning.\"" -> Good.\n\nFinal check of the name. It is Marjorie.\n\nOne detail to check: \""Cecilia found an anonymous tip against me on her phone\"". This implies Cecilia had Ana's phone. That is very suspicious. However, the text spends much more time building the case against Marjorie (the missing Huntsman knife, the purchase at the store, the cleaning obsession). The narrative structure suggests Marjorie is the intended answer. The phone comment might imply Ana was looking at the tip while standing there, or Cecilia stole it. But the \""missing weapon\"" is a classic trope pointing to the culprit. Also, the prompt asks who is the *most likely* murderer based on the narrative's framing. The narrative ends with Winston going to the Johnson estate because of Marjorie.\n\nSo, Marjorie.\n\nFinal Polish:\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to Marjorie, as her specific hunting knife is missing, she was present at the scene, and she purchased a replacement blade that same day.\nANSWER[Marjorie]"", ""schema_retries"": ""0""

Her alibi isn't clearly incriminating, and she lacks a strong motive compared to Danielle.\n\nThe narrative emphasizes Danielle's beliefs and actions more heavily in connection to the murder.\n\nNow, for the final conclusion: I need to wrap up reasoning in 1-2 complete sentences.
