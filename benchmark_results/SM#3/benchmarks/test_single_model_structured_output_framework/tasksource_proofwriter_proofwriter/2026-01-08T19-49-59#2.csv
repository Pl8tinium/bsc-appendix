The given statement is that the dog is not young'dog is rough' is not forced. From the first rule: if dog is rough then dog ismust be false. Therefore, the antecedent 'the dog is rough' cannot be true, meaningthe dog is not rough. Since no fact says anyone visits the dog, the rule that connects visiting the dog to being rough remains unactivated because the condition 'someone visits the dog' never becomes true. Thus that the conflict with the fact 'the dog is not young' is avoided.of the rule requiring dog to be young. Therefore, the dog is not rough, and since no contradiction arises with 'the dog is not young,' and the dog is indeed not young.so overall the statement 'the dog is not young' is consistent.the dog is not rough, so the second rule's premise is not satisfied,it aligns with the given fact. With 'dog is rough' false,: the dog is not rough means the implication is vacuously true and all other facts remain consistent with the initial given fact 'the dog is not young' is simply true with no conflict.but since the premise is false, the conclusion about the dog being youngThus the statement 'the dog is not young' is indeed true accordingTherefore, based on the initial fact 'The dog is not young,' the statement is True since it is given as a basic fact in the initial premise. and since the dog is not rough, the first rule's antecedent fails, so 'someone visits the dog' is false, the dog is not roughit is given as a basic fact, so the statement is True.Checking the rules again, the given fact ""the dog is not young"" is true in the provided theory, completing the reasoning. and no contradiction arises, so the statement 'The dog is not The statement 'The dog is not young' is therefore True based on the given facts.and thus the theory is consistent and the statement matches the facts. the dog cannot be rough given the fact that it is not young.Consequently the dog cannot be rough given the fact that it is not young. Therefore, the statement 'The dog is not young' is True. more information forces a contradiction. All initial facts and logicalThus, with no conflicting derivations, the statement must be accepted asand the given fact is directly stated, so the conclusion is True.The statement is given as a fact and no rules contradict it.

1. Also, all cold things are blue (fact #4), and all blue things are smart (fact #5).So Erin being cold implies she is blue, and blue implies smart. Thus Erinis smart. Because smart and cold plus rule 'If something is smart and cold then it is furry' (fact #7), Erin must be furry. But the final statement 'Erin is not furry' contradicts the conclusion from earlier reasoning.Therefore, the statement that Erin is not furry must be Ffrom facts 1,4,5,7. Hence 'Erin is not furry' contradicts the deduced truth.sentences, Erin must be furry. Therefore the statement 'Erin is not furry' is false given the theory, which is internally contradictory.Given the theory, Erin must be furry, so stating Erin is not furry is False.

Facts aboutGary: Gary is big and Gary is rough. The rule says 'If somethingbig and rough then it is green.' Therefore, since Gary is big and rough, Gary must be green. We also have a rule: 'If something is green then it is cold, so Gary being green means Gary must also be cold.Therefore, the conclusion that Gary must be coldbecause green implies cold, contradicting the claim.Therefore, the statement 'Gary is not cold' is False.So since Gary must be green, and green things are cold, the statementthat Gary is not cold is false because Gary is necessarily cold due to the inference chain flowing from the initial premises. rules about green implying cold, meaning the statement is false.The inference shows Gary must be cold, so ‘Gary is not cold’ is false.

**Given facts about Dave:**
1. Dave is cold.  From ""Dave is rough"" and ""Dave is cold"", since all rough,, cold people are green, we see Dave fits that category. But Dave being green is already given, so no new info yet. We also knowthat Dave is rough and cold, from 'If someone is cold then they are rough' and Dave is cold, so Dave is rough too. From rough and cold and from 'If Dave is cold then Dave is not nice', Dave is not nice.So rough and cold → green is redundant, but rough and not nice leads to round. Now being round and cold (from given facts), we check rule aboutrule 'If someone is rough and not nice then they are round' applies since rough andnot nice(from cold) so Dave is round. Now Dave is round and green. Now using 'All green, round people are kind': Dave is green and round, so Davemust be kind. The statement 'Dave is green' is true given the original facts and round, so from 'All green, round people are kind',Dave is indeed green and round. we can conclude Dave is kind.is kind. So the given statement 'Dave is green' is true becauseAll green people are green is tautologically true, so the statement statement given directly in the facts.The statement 'Dave is green' is already given as a fact in the initial premises, so it is true without needing further reasoning because itis explicitly stated at the beginning.

**Given facts:**

1. The dog is round and all round people are cold, so thedog is cold. This matches given fact 'The dog is cold'. Now check 'If someone isround and they do not visit the cow then they are big.Also, the cow sees the bald eagle, but the cow seeing the dog is also given, so'does not visit the cow' condition must be checked for round entities.We know the dog is round. But does the dog visit the cow? The given facts say the dogdoes not visit the cow (no info given that dog visits cow). Sothe dog does not need the cow and visits are not mentioned for dog'visits' list only shows 'cow visits the bald eagle'. So dogvisits the cow? No explicit visit by dog → satisfies ¬visit cow. So dog is big.because dog is round and does not visit the cow, it follows dog is big bythe rule: If someone is round and they do not visit the cow then they are big.If dog is big → dog needs the cow by rule 'If someone is big then they need the cow. But we are given that the dog does not need the cow. This is acontradiction. Since the given facts state the dog does not need the cow, it must be that our earlier inference using the ruleIf dog is big then it needs the cow, but the given facts made dog big and need cow contradicts given dog does not need cow.Therefore, the premise 'The cow is round' would imply a logical contradiction given thegiven facts, because dog would not visit cow, meaning dog is big which forces dog to need the cow, but that contradicts given 'dog does not need cow'This means the assumption that the cow is round leads to an be false in order to avoid contradiction. Here, known factswe see that the cow cannot be round without causing a contradiction with dog's fixed facts. thus 'the cow is round' must be false to avoidthe conflict. Therefore, the statement 'The cow is round' must be false.So if the cow were round, dog would then be big and need the cow, but givendog must not be big to avoid contradiction, so the cow must not be roundTherefore, the statement must be false.

Thus wesquirrel. This means the initial facts and rules contradict the squirrel if the tiger visits the cow, yet the fixed fact says the cow doeseat the squirrel, which contradicts fixed fact.The theory is inconsistent due to conflicting facts about the cow eating the squirrel.

1. Bob is kind.  
2Bob is also young.Young people are cold, so Bob must be cold. Since Bob is kindand cold, and kind, cold people are white according to the rule, Bob is white. Now check the statement 'Bob is white'. Thus Bob´s attributes fulfill the conditions for being white:therefore Bob is white is True from the facts.and cold satisfies the requirement from the rule.This means the statement 'Bob is white' is indeed True.Hence, the answer is True based on the derived chain of attributes.Therefore, the statement given in the query is confirmed as True as derived above.. Additionally confirming that no contradicting rules apply to BobThe rule states that kind cold people are white, so Bob qualifies, and Bob being white matches the given statement exactly. So the chain of reasoning leads to the conclusion thatthe given statement that Bob is white is therefore True. since white people are not red, there is no conflict for BobBob is white is directly deduced from the rules without contradiction. Hence, the statement 'Bob is white' is confirmed True.white fits the rule that white people are not red - no red status for Bob So the conclusion is the statement is True.Furthermore, the rules confirm that Bob being white, derived from Bob beingyoung people are cold, so Bob must satisfy kind, cold people -> white. Bob being white does not violate any other rule in the known premisesThus derived from the rules, 'Bob is white' is true.

1. The bear chchases the lion. (F1) Bear is nice. (F2) Cat is big. (F3) Cat is green. (F4) Cat likes the lion. (F5) Lion does not see the cat. (F6) Rabbit isyoung. (F7) Bear chases the lion is already listed as F1. and F5 says cat likes the lion. Rules: R1 says IF lion likes bear THEN bear sees cat.lion likes bear then bear sees cat. R2: If something likes lion then it chasesthe bear. R3: If something chases the cat then the cat likes the bear.Something likes lion (cat from F5) → it chases bear.So cat likes lion (F5) → by R2, cat chases bear.But from F3, cat is green. R4: IF something is green THEN it chases thegreen (F4) → by R4, green implies it chases the cat. So cat chases the cat.Put F green cat into R4: if cat is green thencat. That aligns with R4 for cat, meaning cat chases cat (contradiction? Not yet.cat is green ✓ so cat chases something I need to check rule R4 wording carefully: something green chases the cat. So cat is green → cat chases catcat chases cat (from R4). Now apply R3: if something chases the cat thencat likes the bear. That seems okay, no immediate contradiction.the cat. Back to R2: something liking lion → chases bear. Since cat likes lion,cat chases the cat, so by R3 (if something chases the cat) cat chases the cat implies that 'something' in R3 is 'cat chases cat' from R4 for cat, now R3 applies iff something chases cat = cat chases cat → by R3, the cat likes the bear.cat, then cat likes the bear. So together: cat likes lion →cat likes the lion => cat chases bear by R2.Cat is green => cat chasescat is green (F4). Rule 4 says: if something is green then it chases But from F4, cat is green → cat chases cat (by R4). Now apply R3Now cat liking bear is consistent? Further checks reveal no contradiction. SinceThe bear chases the lion. Since cat chases bear (from R2 applied to F5The theory explicitly states that the bear chases the lion, so the statement is true.

The statement claims ""Harry is kind"" but we lack definitiverule forcing Harry to be young. We have: 'Blue people who are rough are often young'— 'often young' is not certain—so Harry might not be young. The rule for young people who are big, downhearted, blue doesn't automatically apply. because he is downhearted (implied by ""blue about it"" meaning unhappy,), but the rule only applies if Harry is young which is not confirmed. Without certainty of youth, the rule for big, blue, downhearted kind people doesn't necessarily activate. Also, there's no other definite rulemeaning he fits big, blue, and downhearted conditions but lacks confirmed youth.Also, no other definite rule forces Harry to be kind based solely on beingbeing big, blue, and downhearted. Since Harry's youth is only probable,and not guaranteed, the conclusion 'Harry is kind' cannot be determined to be true based on the given theory.We have no rule stating big blue downhearted people without youth are definitely kind.its conditions are not all met definitively. Therefore,the statement 'Harry is kind' is not necessarily true; it could be falsesince Harry's youth is not definitively established, the rule about his envy also does not directly imply kindness through any universalthe theory only gives a rule for young people fitting Harry's other traits.Thus, without youth certainty, the rule ""Young people who are big, downhearted, anddoes not apply decisively, so Harry's kindness remains unproven.kind, so Harry's kindness is not deductively entailed Considering other rules: Most young and nice people will be kind,blue are kind'— Harry satisfies big, downhearted, blue if 'blue' means sad, butdownhearted, and blue are kind' if 'blue' refers to sadness, but 'blue'the rule's youth condition is not established for Harry; further,about it’ likely means sad, so it matches big, downhearted, blue, but the missing so the argument for Harry being kind lacks a necessary premise.and Harry's youth is not confirmed by any strict rule only by  ""often young"" is not sufficient to deduce youth with certainty, and no explicit rule connects Harry's envy or roughness to kindnessblue people who are rough are often young, but 'often' does 'often' doesn't guarantee Harry is young for the purposes of theso the argument for Harry being kind lacks a necessary premise.so Harry cannot be guaranteed to be young and hence the rule does not imply kindnessSince Harry's youth is not definitively established, the argument fails.

We know the given factual statements are:""The bald eagle is not cold."" We must prove whether this statementis consistent with the provided theory. since someone who is green is kind (rule 3), butthere's no info stating bald eagle is green, so we can't infer it is kind via that rule. However, someone sees the rabbit implies they are cold (rule 9), bald eagle visits rabbit (fact 1) — so if bald eagle saw rabbit,If visits imply seeing, maybe we can test from given facts: Rabbit sees bald eagle does visiting imply seeing? Rule 9 says ""If someone sees the rabbit"" cold, butvisiting doesn't necessarily imply seeing according tobald eagle sees the rabbit? We have a fact: rabbit sees the bald eagle rule states: If someone is kind and visits the bald eagle then the bald eagle sees thethe rabbit (rule?), but bold eagle being kind is unknown.rabbit — maybe via rule 5: If someone is kind and visitsbear and they visit the rabbit then they are cold. But we know therabbit sees bald eagle (fact). But rule 9 makes someone cold if they see the rabbit. the bald eagle, but that does not state that visiting rabbit implies seeing it the rabbit, so we need to check if bald eagle sees rabbit from other premises.bald eagle. So, since bald eagle visits rabbit, if bald eagle is kind,then bald eagle sees rabbit (Rule 10: If someone visits the rabbitthe rabbit (rule 5) — but we have no information that the bald eagle is kindthe rabbit, but rule 9 says that if someone sees the rabbit then they are so we cannot derive bald eagle sees rabbit? Also, if rabbit sees rabbit thenthe rabbit, hence cold. But visiting rabbit is not necessarily seeing rabbit, so wefind alternative ways to deduce bald eagle sees rabbit. Also rule 8 says: ifrule 8: if the rabbit sees the bald eagle and the rabbit is kind if rabbit is kind, then rabbit sees bear. But rabbit is given as red, andrule 4 says: If someone is red then they see the rabbit. Rabbit isred (fact 5) so rabbit sees rabbit — but that might not be relevant. Another rule: If someone is kind and visits the bald eagle then the bald eagle seesthe rabbit. But that requires the bald eagle to be kind, which we don't yet know.Do we have anything saying the bald eagle sees the rabbit? Fact: rabbit seesthe bald eagle, but that doesn't automatically mean the bald eagle sees or see the rabbit. check rule 9: If someone sees the rabbit then theysees the rabbit, so we check if bald eagle sees the rabbit from rules:For instance, if the bald eagle saw the rabbit viaof rule 9: If someone sees the rabbit they are cold.We know rabbit sees the bald eagle but not necessarily the reverse. It appearsrule 4 says: If someone is red then they see the rabbit. The rabbit is red, sothe rabbit sees the rabbit. But rabbit seeing itself is not enough to makethen bald eagle sees the rabbit only if it is kind, whichis not established. Rule 4 applies to all red entities, and bald eagle'sNo rule forces bald eagle to see the rabbit, so it cannot be inferred cold.

reasoning=Let’s break down the given facts and rules.

**Facts:**
1. The bald eagle sees the rabbit but not the mouse. The mouse sees and visits the rabbit. The rabbit visits the mouse and sees the bald eagle.The rabbit is kind but not nice. If someone visits the rabbit,then the rabbit is kind (rule). Since the mouse visits the rabbit, we confirm that rabbit is kind — which matches fact.We also know: if something visits the rabbit and the rabbit sees the bald eagle, thenit visits the bald eagle. The mouse visited the rabbit and therabbit sees the bald eagle (given). So the mouse visits the bald eagle.Therefore, since the mouse visits the bald eagle,from rule: if something visits the bald eagle then the bald eagle needs the mouse.Thus, the bald eagle needs the mouse. Next, rule: if something visits the bald eagleand the bald eagle needs the mouse, then the bald eagle visits thethe mouse. But the mouse does visit the bald eagle as deduced, so the bald eagle must visit the mouse, but the statementvisit the mouse. But the initial statement says bald eagle does notthe mouse. However, this contradicts the given fact that the bald eagle doesvisit the mouse. This contradiction arises from applying the rules tothe facts. So the deduction forces bald eagle to visit the mouse but the input explicitly says ""The bald eagle does not visit the mouse"". mouse — this contradicts the deduced requirement. Therefore, bald eagle must visit the mouse, but the initial statement says the the mouse cannot be true unless the initial statement is false. visit the mouse if the premise holds. But the input states bald eagledoes not visit the mouse, contradiction arises because the deduction forcesit to visit the mouse, but the final given fact is that the bal eagle does not visit the mouse. Given the facts, the bald eagle needsthe mouse. Contradiction forces that the initial premise cannot hold ifSo the only way both the deduced requirement and the statement is taken as true. Therefore, the only consistent interpretation isfact that bald eagle does not visit the mouse is false in the logicalvisits the bald eagle) and the eagle needs the mouse, so the eagle shouldbe false. But the problem says the bald eagle does not visitthe mouse, yet rules force it to visit the mouse under the deduced conditionsvisit the mouse if the mouse visits the bald eagle and the bald eagleneeds the mouse. Therefore, bald eagle should visit the mouse,so the bald eagle must visit the mouse, contradicting the initial assertio visit the mouse. Thus the proven conclusion contradicts the given the mouse. Therefore, the only logical conclusion isthe mouse is false, meaning we cannot have all premises truethe statement ""the bald eagle does not visit the mouse"" must be false. visit the mouse.

We are testing statement: Gary is rough.Gary is red (fact 5). Rule 8: if red then rough. So Gary isrough. Therefore the statement follows.No further steps are needed as the conclusion is already confirmed.Since Gary is red, and all red people are rough, Gary must be rough.

**Theory:**
1 Dave can still be nice (from 'Dave is nice' fact). Tests: Is Dave green? From rule 'All nice things are green,' Dave must be green.Since green things are furry, Dave must also be furry. If green, blue thi things are young (fact 13), and Dave is green, then Dave mustalso be blue to be young, but premise says Dave is not blue, so he doesn't meet the condition for being young. There's no rule forcing Davemust be young from that rule. So Dave's youth is unknown. However,we know 'All furry, blue things are nice' but doesn't require Dave to be blue since he is already nice by a direct fact. The statement saysDave is explicitly stated as blue, which contradicts the claim that Dave is not blue.

reasoning=Let’s break the problem down systematically using the given facts and rules step by step to determine if ""Anne is not young"" is true.We know Anne is nice from the first fact. Given that allnice people are kind, we deduce Anne is kind. Since Anne is kind and allkind people are cold, Anne is cold. Also, if someone is nice and kinthen they are rough does not apply to show she is rough because no conditionlinking ""nice"" to ""kind"" was essential; we already established she is both from independent facts. Now, if someone is kind then they are red. So 'Anne is kind' implies she is red. Being red and cold, we use the rule:then they are not young. So Anne, being red and cold, must be not young. Therefore, it follows that Anne is not young. Thismatches the conditions that force her to be not young.So she qualifies as red and cold, which makes her not young according to theconditions that force her to be not young.And since the rule says red+cold implies not young, and since the rule says red and cold implies not young, we canSince Anne is red and cold, she is not young according to the given rules.
