**Given facts:**
1. Bob is not furryand Charlie is young. Gary is rough. Rule: Rough, furry people are not round.Rule: If someone is nice then they are round. If someone is quiet then they areround. Rule: If someone is quiet then they are round. Rule: Round, youngpeople are furry. All furry people are young. If someone is furry then they are nice.young. So all fuzzy people are young? Wait thats directly stated: All furry people are young. Rule: If someone is furry then they are nice. Ifsomeone is young and not kind then they are rough. All young people are quiet.Let me check the statement 'Charlie is furry' step-by-step. Charlie is young (given). Since all young people are quiet,Charlie is quiet.Therefore, Charlie is round. Since round, young people arefurry, so Charlie is furry. Therefore the statement 'Charlie is furry' is true.(because if someone is quiet then they are round), and round, young people are furry, Charlie is young so Charlie is furryTherefore, the logical chain confirms that Charlie must be furry.Thus, Charlie must be furry.

Then, from the rule""If something is green then it is cold"" we get Gary is cold. Now, we can apply the rule 'All cold things are furry'. Since Gary is cold,Gary must be furry. This completes the deduction for thededuction for the statement Gary is furry. So the statement is True.

## Theory (facts about individuals and rules linking properties): 1. Bobis cold, is red, is smart. 2. Charlie is red. 3. Dave is green, is smart. 4.Gary is cold. 5. Green, smart people are blue. 6. Cold people are blue. 7. If someone is nice and smart then they are red. 8.If someone is green then they are red. 9. Cold, red people are green. 10.All blue people are nice. 11. If someone is blue and nice then they are smart. 12.If someone is smart and blue then they are cold. Statement: Dave is not red.Since Dave is green and smart (fact 5), Dave is blue. Fromrule 10, Dave is nice. From rule 8, if someone is green then they are red.Dave is green → Dave is red (rule 8). That meansDave being green means rule 8 forces him to be red. But the statement says ""Dave is not red"" contradicts what rule 8 forces. Thus we checkthe theory. Rule 8 directly states green → red, so Dave should be red. Therefore, from the theory Dave must be red, making the statementfrom deductions. But the given statement claims Dave is not red. is true in the theory? That seems conflicting—but there’s rulerule 9: cold & red → green. Possibly this chain leads to inconsistency, makingthe theory inconsistent? Dave is green (given fact); rule 8 = greenTherefore, the statement cannot be true under the theory. ANSWER[False]

**Facts and rules from the text:**
Gary is described as 'a blue and green creature' in thestatement. But the final sentence says: Gary is not blue.However, the theory states Gary is blue and green. This createsan immediate contradiction. Therefore, based on the given facts, but the final sentence contradicts that statement about Gary. This makes ""Gary is not blue"" false sincGary is stated to be blue, so the claim that Gary isthe information already given establishes Gary is blue. false according to the theory's earlier explicit description of Gary.is false because earlier it says Gary is blue. Therefore the final statementthe description of Gary as 'blue and green' in the theory directly statesthat Gary is indeed blue, so the statement is False. is inconsistent with the theory. Thus, 'Gary is not blue' is false because Gary is explicitly described asthe theory given at the beginning.blue in the text before the final statement. Hence, the claim ""Gary is blue. Consequently, the statement 'Gary is not blue' must be falseis inconsistent. the explicit description of Gary as ""blue and green"" directly contradicts the claimis explicitly declared blue and green, contradicting the final statement.the final statement that ""Gary is not blue"" is False. since the theory states explicitly that Gary is blue and green. within the theory. Therefore, the statement must be false because the theory explicitly states thatThe theory states Gary is blue and green, so the statement is false. ANSWER[False]

**1. List given facts: Bob is nice and kind, but a little rough.Now, find rules that connect Bob’s attributes to being young: Rules say around shaped and young aged person will be very cold. Also: kind peoplewho look green are almost always young in age. But Bob is not stated to be green.we need to establish if Bob looks green.We need to check if Bob is green from other rules. Rule: A person who is kind but alsoalso rough and colored blue will be shaped round. Being round leads to being very coldfrom the earlier rule. However, Bob is not stated to be blue, and no rule makesBob blue from the existing facts? He is not mentioned as blue,Based on the given facts no rule infers Bob must be green.Bob is kind, rough, but is he blue? No, no rule gives Bob property blue.skipping checking for green involves checking for roundness, which Thus Bob cannot be deduced to be round unless he is blue, buthe is not blue. Therefore Bob cannot be determined to be round,and thus not round, and so being young is not entailed from the given theory.so without Bob being blue, we cannot deduce roundness, and without roundness or cold, so Bob's youth cannot be deduced via round-ness leadingBob is kind but not stated blue so cannot deduce round via that rule; youth viato cold or green look; the theory doesn't imply Bob is youngway from cold or green look; theory lacks a premise as Bob might be young from other means.the only link between youth and Bob’s known traits is too indirect because no rule directly states that being nice, kind, and rough implies youthBob is only known to be nice, kind, rough but not shown to be blue or greenOnly from given facts, 'Bob is young' cannot be proven true.

**Facts given:**

1. The dog chases the bald eagle. If someone likes the bald eagle then they chase the bald eagle. So from ‘The dog likes the bald eagle’ we inferthat the dog chasing the bald eagle is consistent with the rule.Therefore, the bald eagle needs the dog by applying the rule: 'If someone chases the bald eagle then the bald eagle needs the dog.' Using 'someone' = dog, thisdirectly implies 'the bald eagle needs the dog'. However, the statementtherefore 'the bald eagle needs the dog' is true, contradicting the sentence claim.the rule in line 1 forces 'the bald eagle needs the dog' to be true, so the bald eagle not needing the dog, as claimed at the end,is contradicted by the rule set. Thus, the conclusion is that claimis false because the dog chases the bald eagle,must be false since we deduced the opposite from the factsThe bald eagle does not need the dog' is false.(from Rule 1). Thus the statement 'The bald eagle does not need the dog' is false.So the statement 'The bald eagle does not need the dog' is false.Thus making the statement 'The bald eagle does not need the dog' proven false.The bald eagle needs the dog.directly contradicts the fact that the bald eagle needs the dog. of the rule known from the initial facts that the dog chases the bald eagle.Therefore, the bald eagle needs the dog, making the statement false. ANSWER[False].

### **Theory Re: we know Fred is round, nice, green, big, and kind.Also, Fred is not cold. The rule says: if someone is big, kind, and cold,they will be young. Fred is big and kind but not cold, so therule does not trigger for Fred, so wecannot conclude Fred is young, so we cannot conclude Fred is young.Thus, the premise of the rule does not hold for Fred, andthe statement 'Fred is young' remains unknown based on the given theory.the rule does not trigger for Fred, so we cannot deduce that Fredis young. Since being red applies to all young peoplebut without cold, it's insufficient to conclude youthfrom Fred's known traits according to the stated rules.Therefore, the statement ""Fred is young"" is is not forced by the theory, so we evaluate the statement as false. the statement can only be considered false because thenot forced by the theory, so it must be false.There is no other rule linking big and kind without cold to being youngto Fred's properties. Fred is big and kindis not young, so the statement 'Fred is young' must be false based on availablenot forced by the theory, so it must be false becausethe rules, and the theory does not establish Fred's youth.without cold, the rule doesn't apply, so Fred being young is falsebecause Fred lacks the 'cold' property required by the rule.So we cannot deduce that Fred is young. Therefore, the statement 'FredThus, there is no basis to conclude that Fred is young. being cold for the rule connecting youth to big, kind, cold individuals.Therefore, with no information stating Fred is young and no rulethat applies to Fred's known traits, we cannot concludethe premises required by the rule connecting youth to being big, kind, and is young' must be considered false.

Without cold, the rule doesn't apply, leaving no basisstatement 'Fred is young' cannot be concluded true given the rulesand Fred is not cold so the rule cannot conclude Fred is young.So since the antecedent condition (big, kind, cold) is not satisfied Thus, the statement 'Fred is young' is false based on the given information.the given theory.

Since the rabbit is round (given in the facts), applying the rule to the rabbit (something round) forcesit to eat the rabbit.

Therefore, the theory is inconsistent because we have alogical inconsistency in the theory itself, so the premises contain a contradiction, meaningthe rabbit is forced to eat the rabbit by the rule, butthe rabbit cannot eat the rabbit according to explicit fact, which contradicts the given fact that the rabbit doesto eat the rabbit because it is round if the rule is true. the premises, the rabbit is round and the rule ""if something is round thenit eats the rabbit, contradicting its own premise. costs about 7 billion per tiger; we need to cut spending on militaryrabbit eats the rabbit given the rule, but explicit fact says the rabbit in premise is round, but the rule say if somethin if round rabbit eats itself from rule but premise says it does not eat itself. round then it eats the rabbit.

Therefore,, the statement ""Charlie is not blue"" is False.Thus, the query is false due to a direct contradiction.The initial premises state ""Charlie is blue"" explicitly, sothe statement 'Charlie is not blue' is indeed False.the premise 'Charlie is blue' directly contradicts the claimit contradicts the explicit premise that Charlie is blue. because premises directly state ""Charlie is blue"",so the statement 'Charlie is not blue' is false directly.Thus, the query statement 'Charlie is not blue' is False. The initial premises stateCharlie is blue according to the premises, so it contradicts the explicit premise that Charlie is blue. given that the premises explicitly state that Charlie isBecause the premises establish Charlie is blue, the statementCharlie is blue according to the premises, so the claim is false becauseCharlie is blue (stated in given facts), so the statement 'Charlie is not blue' isthe stated premise. the premises. Hence, we conclude that the statement is false.Hence, we conclude it is false based on the direct contradiction.the statement 'Charlie is not blue' is false because it conflictsThe premise 'Charlie is blue' directly refutes the statement.

**Given facts:**

1. The bear needs the dog. This is given as fact number 1.2. The dog chases the squirrel — BUT the final statement says: ""Dog does not chase the squirrel"" contradicts the earlier given fact ""The dog chasesthe squirrel.So the only definite conclusion is that the theory is contradictory and.Since the dog does not chase the squirrel, then at least one given factis false. This inconsistency means the statement 'Dog does notdoes not chase the squirrel' must be true based on the conflicting facts.the squirrel' is true because the last sentence directly declares it.contradiction in the given premises: the theory says ""dog chases the squirrel"" so the premises are inconsistent. If premises are contradictory yet the final premise explicitly asserts its opposite. This createsthe initial assertion. Therefore, given the explicit final statement mentioned, in logical evaluation, the statement 'The dog does not chase chase the squirrel' is stated as a fact in the problem, so given this an inconsistency with earlier statement #2, then the set of facts isinvalid. Therefore, the only certain fact is the explicit final statementbut since the final statement 'The dog does not chase the squirrel' is presented as true, we must accept it, even if it contradicts the earlier given statement.In logical puzzles, explicit final statements often override prior contradictory ones, but in formal logic we cannot conclude anything from inconsistent premisesThus we cannot conclude any meaningful results except that the premises areimpossible to derive truth because any proposition can be inconsistent. Therefore, the statement ""The dog does not chase the earlier claim. This contradiction makes the entire theory inconsistent, meaningWith contradictory premises, the truth cannot be determined logically.

**Facts given:**

The squirrel needs the lion.lion chases the bear then the cat visits the bear. From ""If something visits visits the squirrel needs the lion', but there is a contradiction because the lion. If something visits the lion then it visits the squirrel.squirrel needs the lion', but no rule says visiting squirrel requiresbe nice but rule says visiting squirrel means 'it' is not nice.'The cat visits the lion' is directly given in the facts, so checking the rules: 'If something visits the lion then it visits the squirrel but rule says visiting squirrel means 'it' is not nice. Also the squirrel sees the lion chases the cat andit needs the lion then the lion does not chase the bear. Now,Rule 'If something visits the squirrel then it chases the cat.Since the cat visits the lion, apply 'If something visits the lion thenit visits the squirrel, so it follows that the cat visits the squirrel. Then from rule ""If something visits the squirrel then it chases the cat,"" so thecat visits the squirrel then the cat chases the cat, which which is possibly contradictory if 'chases' requires a different subject not possible unless 'it' refers to the cat itself, which would implycats don't chase themselves, so this seems impossible.Contradiction arises from applying visiting/chasing rules, so cat visits lion is FALSE.

**Facts given explicitly:**
entence: Therefore Dave is nice given if cold.Also all young things are cold (fact), so Harry is young does not match. Therefore Harry is not cold is false? Check: Harry is youngimplies Harry is cold from ""All young things are cold"". Thus Harry must be cold because Harry is young.but statement says 'Harry is not cold' so this leads to a contradictionThus Harry cannot be not cold — that statement contradicts the rules.But rules imply Harry is young hence cold — meaning Harry must be cold. So statementHarry cannot be not cold because All young things are cold and being Harry is young. So the statement 'Harry is not cold' contradicts facts.So the given statement ""Harry is not cold"" contradicts the rule that all young things imply cold, plus facts:Harry is young, therefore Harry must be cold.Therefore the initial statement is false since Harry must be cold.So the statement 'Harry is not cold' is False because it contradicts thefacts. Specifically, from 'Harry is young' and 'All Harry is not cold' contradicts 'Harry is young' and the ruleAll young things are cold, so if Harry is young as cold, we must conclude Harry is cold, not the opposite.Thus the theory contradicts the claim Harry is not cold. Harry isyoung, so this implies Harry is cold, henceHarry cannot be not cold because facts and rules force HarryThus, the statement 'Harry is not cold' is false according to the theory. ANSWER[False]

**Given facts:**
1. The bald eagle needs the rabbit. 2) The cat sees the bald eagle. 3) The dog is green.4) The rabbit sees the dog. 5) If something is young and it eats the cat, then the cat is green. 6) Green things are red. 7) If something needs the bald eagle then the bald eagle eats the rabbit.From fact 1 (bald eagle needs rabbit) and fact 7 (if something needsthe bald eagle, then bald eagle eats rabbit), we can deduce that bald eagle eats the rabbit. Now, fact 4 says the rabbit sees thedog. Therefore, the statement 'The rabbit does not see the dog' contradicts factdirectly from the given facts. Therefore, the statement is fact 4 (rabbit sees the dog), so the statement 'rabbit does not see the dog' isdirectly contradicts fact 4. Therefore it must be False. fact 4 directly, thus the statement is False.False. Therefore, I conclude the statement is false based on the givenAdditionally, since fact 6 says green things are red, and fact 3 says false.The statement is false because fact 4 explicitly states 'The rabbit sees thethe dog is green', which is consistent with fact rules, but irrelevantdog', so claiming it does not see the dog contradictsthe rabbit sees the dog and not the opposite. So the original claim is false. explanation. The given rules about color and age do not affectthis direct conflict between the statement and fact 4.this reasoning because the bald eagle eating the rabbit doesn'tthe rabbit sees the dog and not the opposite. So the original claim isthe rabbit sees the dog.

But the cat does not visit the bald eagle, so no one visited the cat — which means the bald eaglemust not have visited the cat (contradicts fact 'bald eagle visits the cat') — visits the cat — which is impossible given cat does not visit the eagle.So this implies for the 'cat visits the eagle' to be false, since cat does not visit eagle implies no one visited cat must be false, forcing that `someone visits the cat` is false.But in facts bald eagle visits the cat, which triggers the rule that cat visits the bald eagle, which contradicts the given fact that the cat does notbald eagle. But that clashes with the premise ""The cat does not visit the bald eagle"" bald eagle. That creates contradiction because bald eagle visiting the catmpletes implication in rule, requiring cat visits eagle.This means the bald eagle visiting the cat cannot be true if the cat does not visit eagle implies no one visited cat but bald eagles visit the cat. But ""visits the cat"" is a fact given forbald eagle, so the only resolution is a contradiction in the theory.cat visits eagle. So bald eagle visiting cat and cat not visiting eagle is impossible because 'If someone visits the cat then the cat visits the bald eagle' is triggered, contradicting the statement the cat visits the bald eagle. Given `bald eagle visits the cat`, thus forcing `cat visits eagle` to be true, contradicting 'the cat d provided 'The cat does not visit the bald eagle'. This creates a logicalTherefore “The cat does not visit the bald eagle” must befalse in the given premises due to the bald eagle visiting the cat triggering the ruleTherefore, 'The cat does not visit the bald eagle' leads to a contradiction because 'bald eagle visits the cat' already forces 'cat visits the eagle' to be true.Here’s the logical conflict: 'If someone visits the cat from visiting the bald eagle. Hence, the statement is false.eagle visits the cat', causing cat visits bald eagle, soeagle visits the cat' already forces 'cat visits the eagle' to be true.This directly contradicts the given statement thatbald eagle visits the cat. With this premise, the rule 'If someone visits the cat, but the facts state bald eagle visits the cat, socat visits the bald eagle' is forced by the bald eagle's visit yet the theory says bald eagle visits the cat.the cat does not visit the bald eagle. Given 'bald eagle visitscat visits the bald eagle' to be true, which directly contradicts the statementThus, the statement 'The cat does not visit the bald eagle' is False. ANSWER[False]

reasoning=Let’s break this down.

**Step 1 — Facts given:**

1. The cat chases the lion. 2. The cat eats the lion. 3. Cat is green. 4. Cat is red.5. The cat sees the lion. 6. The lion chases the cat. 7. The lion eats the cat.8. The lion is big. 9. The lion is kind. 10. The lion sees thelion. Additionally, 'The lion does not see the lion' is provided separately as lion. However, that contradicts rule about 'something is greensees itself, likely a given fact meaning the lion sees the lion but that's contradictory with the earlier positive fact 'The lion sees the lion'.Checking rules: 'If something is green then it is red' — cat is green, sothe cat is red from rule 'green → red', so both green and red.implies the cat is red, which is consistent with fact 4.Fact 10 'The lion sees the lion' conflicts with 'The lion does not seethe lion', so one must take 'The lion does not see the lion' as an overriding fact.So fact 10 'lion sees lion' seems false; probably it was meant to be:Let's begin again without the invalid statement.sees the cat')(Fact 6), lion is big (Fact 8), so applyrule: 'If something is big and sees the cat then it sees the lion.' Thing = lion.So, fact 10 'The lion sees the cat' is true from given facts. Using 'Lfactual; so 'lion sees cat' is true, then rule: big & sees cat → sees lion.: lion is big and lion sees the cat → lion sees the lion. But given 'lion does not seethe lion' contradicts the rule's conclusion, meaning there is an inconsistency inthe premises since 'lion sees lion' would be derived from the rule but is stated asthis would imply the premises are inconsistent, therefore any conclusion followssee the lion' leads to a contradiction with derived 'lion sees lion'. Thus: big & sees cat → sees lion applies to lion, so lion sees lion. But not see the lion' given as extra fact, conflict emerges.the lion sees the cat and is big, therefore the lion sees the lion, so the theory becomes inconsistent. Given that inconsistency,premises (lion big, lion sees cat) imply lion sees lion and thus the premises imply both 'lion sees lion' and 'lion does not see lion'. Thatmakes the set of facts inconsistent. Therefore, any conclusion— a contradiction. This means the premises are inconsistent. and so the premises are inconsistent because the lion cannot both slion and not see the lion simultaneously. In such an inconsistent set,and not see the lion. This violates the law of non-contradiction, meaning, implying the premises are inconsistent. Since the theory entailsso any statement would be both true and false under logical explosion.the theory is inconsistent. An inconsistent theory meanscontradiction, any statement can be derived. So if asked whether any proposition Therefore, any statement given would be both truthe theory entails a contradiction — specifically that the lion sees the lion andThe premises are inconsistent, so the final truth value is indeterminate.

**Given facts about individuto reach a conclusion about whether ""Harry is not rough"" is true, because any blue thing is not rough according to the last sentence, andthe last argument was: if Harry were blue, then Harry would indeed be not rough.But we don't know if Harry is blue or not; we must check the rules. We know Harry is furry. Rule ""furry things are white"" means Harry is white. Also,Harry is furry and furry things are white, so Harry is white. Also Harry is quiet. so Harry is furry and white and quiet, but Harry is white because furry things are white. Harry is quiet. From the rule:If Harry is quiet and white, then he is kind. But fromgiven fact 'If Harry is quiet and Harry is white then Harry is kind', we can apply it. Harry qualifies for that: quiet and white applies.Thus by modus ponens, Harry is kind. Rule: All kind things are red, sothus Harry is kind.All kind things are red, so Harry is red,so Harry is red. Rule: Quiet, red things are blue. Harry is quiet and Harry is red, so Harry must be blue by the rule Quiet, red things are blue.Since Harry is blue, rule ""All blue things are not rough""means ""Harry is not rough"" is true. Harry is blue, so Harry is not rough by the rule, therefore Harry is not rough. This proves the statement, hence 'Harry is not rough' is True given the given rulesTherefore, since Harry is blue, all blue things are not rough, so Harry is not rough.

**Theory:**
1. Bob is quiet.  
2.Charlie is kind. Bob is quiet but not kind? Well, we know Bob is quiet,and Charlie being kind doesn't directly relate. If Bob is quiet and not kind, according to rule 2, Bob would be furry because of rule 2. But rule 2 requires 'quiet and not kind'. We knowBob is quiet, and Charlie is kind, so Bob is not Charlie. So Bob isnot necessarily not kind — we don't know Bob's kindness unless stated otherwise; will deduce later.Actually, from facts, Bob is quiet but we don't know if Bob is kind or not.Also, fact: Fiona is furry. Then statement says Fiona is not furry. Thiscontradicts the explicit fact Fiona is furry.The problem statement contradicts itself immediately, making the final statement 'Fiona is not furry' false becausethe starting fact directly tells us that Fiona is furry; therefore, so the statement 'Fiona is not furry' is false because the initial fact is directly contradicted by the initial fact that Fiona is furry.We stated 'Fiona is furry' originally, but then the final statement says Fiona isis furry. Therefore, the statement contradicts an explicit initial fact.So 'Fiona is not furry' contradicts the given fact, hence it is false.impossible given the initial fact in the theory. Therefore, the statementis False because it contradicts the explicit fact in the theory that Fionais furry. The statement 'Fiona is not furry' is therefore directly given in the facts. Thus, the final claim 'Finn is furry'Therefore, 'Fiona is not furry' is false. against the given fact that Fiona is furry, meaning the statementSo the statement ""Fiona is not furry"" contradicts the initialfurry from the first fact, so the final sentence contradicts it the known fact that Fiona is furry. Therefore, the statement is False.Given that Fiona is furry according to the initial facts due to the direct conflict with the established premise that Fiona is furry. The: 'Fiona is furry' is stated directly in the facts, so shejust contradicts 'Fiona is furry' stated upfront, making thegiven fact Fiona is furry directly contradicts this final statementimmediately contradicted by the given fact ""Fiona is furry"". argument irrelevant given the direct contradiction between facts.is furry, meaning the final statement is false.No reasoning is needed beyond noting this direct contradiction.Logically, therefore, it is false because the premise itself directly is false due to a direct contradiction with the given fact that Fiona is furry. Because the theory explicitly states Fiona is furry, the claiminitial fact 'Fiona is furry' directly contradictsTherefore, the statement is false. ANSWER[False]

**Given:**

1. The bear is big.  
2. Ththe cow needs the cow (from 5). But if something needs the cow then it is blue (4),so lion is blue. Now, we must check if the cow sees the lion: from 3 & 4, 'If something needs the cow then it is blue'. So if lion needs the cow then cow needs itself? Wait check 5: If somethingsees the cow then it needs the cow.' So if lion needs the cow, does cow sees the lion?No, that doesn't follow directly. But statement 6 says: If the cow does not see the lion and the cow does not chase the tiger then the lion needs the bear. we don't know if the cow sees the lion yet. Let's see statement 6: the cow needs the cow (from 5). But if something needs the cow then it is blue (4),needs the cow then it is blue. Therefore lion is blue. Now,we know 'something needs the cow' implies 'it is blue'. Therefore lion sees the lion, but we don't know yet. But statement 6 says: If thelion sees the cow? Step back: We know lion needs the cow from statement.lion needs the cow; from rule 5, if something sees the cow thensomething needs the cow; from (4), lion is blue. Rule 5 says lion needs the cow; from rule 4, if something needs the cow then it is blue, so blue is true for lion. But this chain doesnRule 5 says: if something sees the cow then it needs the cow. We already knowTherefore, the statement 'the lion needs the cow' is false based on the theory.

Therefore, for Dave to be round, he must be blue. Dave is not stated to be blue initially, but check if Dave can be deduced blue via other rules smart, rough person is big (""All green, rough people are big"").Dave is green and rough, hence by rule All green, rough people are big. So Dave is big. Rule: If Dave is big then Dave is round. . So 'If Dave is big then Dave is round' gives Dave is round.because Dave is green and rough, making him big. Therefore Dave is round.

**Facts givHowever, the statement says Harry is not young.en: Harry is round and nice, so by the rule that a round andrule, Harry must have a red tint.

Since beingbig and having a red face and blue feeling implies big by another rule, we know someone with a red face, feels blue, But Harry is not young, so he cannot be big, meaningthe premise about big-cold-round doesn’t force him to be big, soHarry cannot match all three conditions (red face, blue feeling, round body) that imply being big.
