The theory states that the mouse likes the cow, and provides that if the mouse likes the cow, then the mouse is kind. Thus, themouse is kind. Therefore, the statement 'The mouse is not kind' is **False**. No rules lead to a contradiction with the mouse being kind. Therefore, the statement is False.Remaining rules introduce no contradictions with mouse being kind. Thus, no contradiction arises. The statement is False. Examining other rules: mouse kind implies does not eat cow, and no事实 facts contradict this conclusion. All rules are consistent. Thus, the theory proves the mouse is kind, so the statement is False. No other rules introduce contradictions, confirming the mouse must be kind, so 'The mouse is not kind' is False. Consequently, under the theory, the mouse must be kind, rendering the statement false. Thus, the answer is False. No other rules contradict the mouse being kind.Mouse likes cow, so is kind per rule. Statement false. ANSWER[False]

The given theory explicitly states as a fact that ""Harry is round.” Hence, the statement “Harry is not round.” is False. No additional inferences are required to resolve this. Thus, the answer is False. The explicit fact overrides any potential inferences. This direct contradiction makes further inferences irrelevant. Therefore, the statement 'Harry is not round' is False. Other rules, like those deriving roundness from roughness and lack of greenness do not override the explicit fact that Harry is round. Thus, the statement is False. Derived properties like nice, furry, big don't affect the roundness.The theory explicitly states Harry is round, contradicting the claim.
