She also has access to and expertise with tridents, and knowledge of Stephen’s routine at the library. However, the murder weapon being from her gym doesn’t necessarily mean she took it, especially if others had access. Meanwhile, Lowell’s behavior is unusually detached—his connection to the library through deliveries gives him both access and opportunity. His lack of emotional response to tragedy, combined with his possession of an antique trident and habitual early visits to the library, aligns more closely with the crime scene. The trident used might not be gym equipment, but part of his collection. The key clue is location: Stephen was killed in the quiet crevices of the library—somewhere Lowell regularly had solitary access before opening hours. Sophie, while hostile, had no known entry to the library at that hour.

Lloyd had a clear reason to want Russell silenced. However, the physical evidence must also be weighed. The shovel—found in Lloyd’s car—was the murder weapon. While he explained it as a remnant from his past landscaping work, the timing raises suspicion. Yet, we must also consider Naomi’s behavior. She claimed she found Russell’s body after returning from gardening, but security footage shows her using a shovel the day before the murder, and her hands are calloused from digging. More crucially, she stated, 'And then I found him. Evidently when I was gardening...'—a strange choice of words. It implies she discovered the body in the context of gardening, suggesting she may have been in the act of burying or digging near the body. Furthermore, the shovel used in the murder could easily have come from her recent gardening activities. The irony noted in the narrative—that Russell helped her dig holes for flowers—implies the shovel had sentimental or symbolic value, possibly escalating emotional tension. Naomi’s reclusive behavior, midnight walks, and emotional detachment during questioning are atypical for a grieving mother. Combined with her access to the cabin, presence via inheritance, and physical evidence linking her to shovel use, the balance of suspicion shifts.

Rainforests don’t have lawns; they’re dense, wild ecosystems where such machinery would be unusable. This suggests the murder didn’t occur in a natural rainforest setting, or the 'rainforest' referenced is artificial—perhaps a greenhouse, exhibit, or themed park. That makes the location suspect. Additionally, Jesse’s death by lawnmower implies access to both the machine and a space where it could operate—like a maintained lawn. Sam works at a landscaping business, has expertise with heavy machinery, and has motive: betrayal over his girlfriend. Steve, though a volunteer in forest cleanups, has no known mechanical skill, and his alibi is studying religious texts—unless 'the forest' is metaphorical. But Winston’s question about synagogue events being open suggests Steve could have been elsewhere without notice. However, the biggest clue is the impossibility of using a lawnmower in a real rainforest. Therefore, the crime likely occurred not in the wild, but in a controlled environment—like the landscaping yard or a greenhouse—pointing to Sam, who has access, skill, and motive. The mention that 'no one else was in the rainforest' during the trip might be a lie or misdirection, especially if the 'rainforest' was actually a man-made installation near a school or business. Sam’s father’s business, 'Green Leaves Landscaping,' could have such a display. Jesse may have gone there, not on the actual trip. Sam had the means, opportunity, and emotional motive.

CCTV places her near the crime sceneand at the time of the murder she was seen on CCTV leaving her employer's home just moments before the estimated time of Ana's death.She had the means, the opportunity, and a strong motive tied to herlivelihood.
