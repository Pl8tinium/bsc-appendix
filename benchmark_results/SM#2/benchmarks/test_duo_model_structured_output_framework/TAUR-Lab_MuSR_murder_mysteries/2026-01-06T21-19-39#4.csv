Yet, the most damning detail is that only someone with access to the specific venom—and the knowledge to use it—could have committed the murder.

Both suspects have connections to martial arts and nunchaku—Timothy through his obsession with hischaracters and Adam through his personal practice. However, Adam has a direct motiveand stands to lose credibility and potentially face legal consequencesdue to Eugene's public allegations about safety violations at his zoo.This provides a clear incentive for Adam to silence Eugene, creating a much stronger motive compared to Timothy,whereas Timothy’s connection to nunchaku is purely research-based fora fictional character. Furthermore, Adam was seen handling a nunchaku and had anunchaku he purchased from his own zoo’s gift shop, giving him directaccess to the murder weapon and a plausible scenario where he could havebrought it to the laser tag event without raising suspicion, while hismartial arts practice during feeding times provides him opportunityhis regular use of the weapon makes it more likely hesystematically use it as a lethal weapon in the heat of an argument.His familiarity with the nunchaku as a practiced tool rather than aStrong motive from Eugene's safety allegations points to Adam as the murderer.
