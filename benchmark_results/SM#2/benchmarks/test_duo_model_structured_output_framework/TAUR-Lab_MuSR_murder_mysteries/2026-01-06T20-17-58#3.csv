Meanwhile, Imogen's motive stems from financial desperation, but there's no direct evidence linking her to the syringe or the scene. Fred’s access during the night shift, his presence at the studio, and his suspicious behavior increase his culpability. The syringe as a murder weapon may point to someone with medical knowledge, which favors Imogen, but syringes are not impossible to obtain for others, especially in a world adjacent to performance-enhancing drugs or medical visits. However, Giselle was found with the syringe at the scene—meaning the killer may have used it and left it behind, possibly in haste. Fred, as the night guard, would have had both opportunity and the ability to stage or overlook details. His notebook could be a cover for documenting his own actions. The fact that he overheard Giselle’s conversation about exposing him suggests he took active notice—possibly acted on it. Imogen, while emotionally and financially entangled, had no physical access to the studio at night, no indication of being present, and no opportunity established. Fred, however, was already inside during the time of death. Motive, means, and opportunity converge more strongly on him. The evidence leans heavily toward Fred as the most likely murderer.

He researched harmful substances and wasand had made purchases of corrosive substances, indicating both access and opportunity as he was at the gym late that night. Addison also had a motivebut his motive was financial gain through theft, not personal vendetta, while Addison's presence was recorded, it appears less likelywhereas Irving's combination of motive, expertise, and access to acidmakes him seem like the more probable culprit. The evidence points more stronglyto Irving being the more likely perpetrator due to the direct threat compared to the circumstantial evidence against Addison for theft,and the discovery of the vial linked to his car further solidifies theANSWER[Irving]
