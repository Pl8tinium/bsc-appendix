1. **Motive for Frank:**  
   -Lola was blackmailing Frank about academic misconduct, which threatens hiscareer and reputation—a strong motive for murder. Frank also owns katanas, which were sharpened recently, placing him physically near the cabin and matches the murder weapon type. His alibi is weak since witnesses saw him near thecabin on the day of the murder, and he lied about his relationship with the crime scene. Isabelle has means but a weaker motive compared to Frank's's career-ruining secret. Meanwhile, Isabelle had motive from Lola's affair with DaDavid, but her actions seem more about emotional support thanconflict than murder. Frank's motive is stronger — preserving his career from blackmail, and he had both the means (katana skills) and opportunity, opportunity on the day, and no solid alibi. The evidence points most stronglyFrank as the perpetrator, especially given his access to similar weaponryand the fact he purchased a sharpening stone just before themurder, as well as being seen in the area around the time of the crime.; these actions suggest he was preparing for or concealing hanging a sharper stone purchase those days before.ANSWER[Frank]

Sophie had means and possibly opportunity, but lacked a clear motive compared to Lowell.

Thepreponderance of concrete evidence--motive, means, and opportunity--firmly pointstowards Marjorie as the most likely perpetrator.The direct threat Ana posed to Marjorie's livelihood and freedom providesa far more compelling reason for murder than any potential issueTherefore, based on the evidence presented the potential exposure of a minor vendor violation.All conclusive evidence points decisively to Marjorie as the murderer.
