He had a strong motive asWalter was blackmailing and bullying him, giving him a clear reason to kill Walter.However, his fearful nature and lack of direct evidence at the scene make hiscase somewhat weaker than someone with more pressing, immediatethreat from Walter. Glenn, on the other hand, had a motive linked to Walterknowing a damaging secret that Walter threatened to expose. Glenn also had opportunity, as he was at the zoo at the time of the murder with atool bag according to an eyewitness, and he had access tosimilar nails and was seen acting nervously when questioned by Winston.Glenn's motive was stronger because Walter's threat todisclose Glenn’s criminal record could ruin his life and family, whichis a more immediate and desperate motive for murder than prolonged bullying.ANSWER[Glenn]
