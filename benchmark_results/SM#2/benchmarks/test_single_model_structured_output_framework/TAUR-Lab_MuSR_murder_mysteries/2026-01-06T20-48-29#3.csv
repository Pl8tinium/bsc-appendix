The narrative explicitly mentions that Xenia had motive (Charlotte planned to reveal her secret relationship)and access as the wedding planner handling setup and cleanup around the time ofthe murder, but also fits the timeline perfectly. However, Priscilla was spottedat the temple during the exact time of the murder and had gang rivalry with Charlotte, explicit opportunity, and barbed wire knowledge from hiking.Both suspects clearly had means and motive, but Priscilla had eyewitnesses placingher physically at the scene, which gives her the strongest immediateevidence against her. Winston must weighimmediate forensic plausibility. With wire snips and known gang tension, Priscilla is currently the most likely killer given the eyewitness testimony placingher at the crime scene concurrently with the murder, and the direct physical evidence from the crime scene.So while Xenia had a strong emotional motive, the concrete evidencePriscilla was present at the scene with means and gang rivalry, making her the killer.

From the narrative:  

- **Penelope had opportunity and a possible motive — Kaylee planned to expose her past —she was seen with the pickaxe earlier and her meeting with Kaylee wasbacked by the diary entry, but her childcare background makes violence less likely.Francis had a stronger emotional motive and intimate knowledge of the location, andhad direct evidence: Francis bought the pickaxe, set the meeting, and hadaccess to tools matching the murder weapon. Both had motive, but evidence points more heavily toward Francis because he owned the specific pickaxe andhad means, motive (Kaylee was tormenting his daughter), and opportunityFrancis's familiarity with the pickaxe and mining background gave himskill to use it lethally. The witnessing of Francis buying the murderweapon, along with arranging the meeting and having a clear motiveto protect his daughter from abuse, makes him the most likely murderer, especially since Penelope's connection to the weapon was circumstantial whereasPenelope's circumstantial evidence makes Francis the likelier suspect.additionally, Francis had the emotional drive from witnessing Kaylee threatenhis daughter makes him the more plausible killer than someone with less personal plus Francis had direct physical evidence tying him to the weapon purchase,Francis is the most likely murderer due to direct evidence and stronger motive.

HoweverBella, however, had direct access to the shed and was seen nearby just before thebody's discovery, and was witnessed in a major theft confrontation with Terry, simultaneously Bella had a strong motive from Terry threatening to report her theft, making her seem more desperate and having means given her metalwork skill (could be linked to crafting a makeshift shiv). Jose’s motive centers on job loss and means (present at scene) but lacks the direct link to the murder location; Jose lacks the specific skill and desperation tied to a criminal record.Additionally, Bella's skill with metalworking easily translates to craftinga weapon like a shiv, and her confrontation was more recent and escalated.her recent confrontation with Terry was heated and right before the murder, plusANSWER[Bella]
