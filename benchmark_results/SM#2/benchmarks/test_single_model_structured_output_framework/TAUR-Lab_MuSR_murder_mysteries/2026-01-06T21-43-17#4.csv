The receipt and nails alone don't confirm guilt, but the combination with access, motive, and suspicious behavior matters. Glenn's connection to the zoo at exactly 3 p.m., the bulky tool bag witnessed by a third party, his knowledge of nail types, recent purchase, and Walter's discovery of his criminal past create a stronger, more time-sensitive motive. Dennis may have had reason to fear Walter, but Glenn had a secret to protect—Walter threatening to expose his past implies imminent danger to Glenn's freedom and family life. The tool bag seen on the day of the murder, combined with Glenn's presence at the zoo—offering both access and opportunity—shifts the weight of evidence. Furthermore, Glenn's possession of high-quality nails used for nail guns, his familiarity with such tools (as implied by his roof repair), and the nervous reaction when questioned about nail guns suggest concealment. Dennis, despite his rough edges and associations, showed openness and no direct link to the weapon. No nail gun was tied to him, only nails—which are not inherently incriminating. The pivotal clue is the witness seeing Glenn with a bulky tool bag on the day of the murder, at the zoo, around the time of death, matching both access and means. While Dennis feared Walter, Glenn had a motive to silence him permanently. When Walter said he couldn't keep Glenn's secret much longer, it created a ticking clock. Glenn repaired his roof with nails—demonstrating tool proficiency. The nail gun is a construction tool, and Glenn—unlike Dennis, whose job was construction—had the dual presence at the zoo and a concealed tool bag. The child’s mention of zoo visits reinforces Glenn’s regular presence, possibly enabling planning. Therefore, Glenn fits the profile: motive (exposure of criminal past), opportunity (at zoo that day with tool bag), and access to weapon and nails. The evidence against Dennis, while circumstantial, lacks direct weapon linkage.

The receipt alone does not implicate Dennis definitively, especially since Glenn also bought nails and had access to a nail gun via construction connections. Furthermore, the eyewitness placing Glenn at the zoo with a tool bag around 3 p.m. — feeding time — adds timing relevance.

The nunchaku used in the murder likely came from the zoo gift shop, but possession alone isn’t proof—opportunity and alibi gaps are key. Adam’s feeding schedule aligns with martial arts classes elsewhere, making his presence at such classes unlikely, while Timothy’s weekly class claim lacks corroboration. This absence of verification, combined with his direct access to both the arena and Eugene through scheduled games, positions him as the more likely perpetrator.

Critically, when Detective Winston asked about feeding times, Adam revealed they aligned with martial arts classes at the town sports center, meaning he could not have been in class elsewhere, but this actually creates an opportunity: he could have been at the laser tag event using his nunchaku without raising suspicion, especially since the murder occurred during a public event.
