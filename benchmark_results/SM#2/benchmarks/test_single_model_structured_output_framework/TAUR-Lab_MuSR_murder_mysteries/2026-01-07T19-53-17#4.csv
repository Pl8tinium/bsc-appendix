**Lowell appears to be a potential suspect because he had a strong motive:Stuart was blackmailing him over fraudulent activities, giving Lowell a clear reasonto want Stuart silenced. Furthermore, Lowell was confirmed to be near the zoothe day of the murder due to a bank meeting, and there were emails detailingthe threat of exposure. However, Lowell lacks a direct connection to themurder weapon, whereas Xanthe regularly carried a small hatchet matching thedescription of the weapon used to kill Stuart. Xanthe, on the other handalso had a strong emerging motive: Stuart had recently begun favoring a newbarista named Mary, suggesting jealousy as a motive. This, combined with Xanthe's access to the zoo and her habit of carrying the murder weapon, pointsstrongly towards her. While Lowell had a logical motive tied to blackmail, Xanthe's motive is emotional and personal.murder scenes often involve personal rage rather than cold calculation.The evidence points to Xanthe due to her weapon access and personal motive.
